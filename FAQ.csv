Question,Answer
"What causes rain?", "Rain is formed when water vapor in the atmosphere cools and condenses into droplets that become heavy enough to fall to the ground."
"Why do we have seasons?", "Seasons occur because of the tilt of the Earth's axis, causing different parts of the Earth to receive varying amounts of sunlight throughout the year."
"What is a hurricane?", "A hurricane is a powerful tropical storm with strong winds and heavy rain, typically forming over warm ocean waters."
"What is the difference between weather and climate?", "Weather refers to the short-term atmospheric conditions, while climate is the average weather pattern in a region over a long period."
"How do weather forecasts work?", "Weather forecasts use data from satellites, weather stations, and computer models to predict future atmospheric conditions."
"What is a cold front?", "A cold front is the leading edge of a cooler mass of air, replacing a warmer mass of air, often causing storms and a drop in temperature."
"Why does it get colder at higher altitudes?", "As altitude increases, the air pressure decreases, causing the air to expand and cool."
"What is the greenhouse effect?", "The greenhouse effect is the warming of the Earth's surface due to the trapping of heat by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere."
"What is a meteorologist?", "A meteorologist is a scientist who studies weather and atmospheric conditions to predict and understand weather patterns."
"How does a rainbow form?", "A rainbow forms when sunlight is refracted, dispersed, and reflected inside water droplets in the atmosphere, creating a spectrum of light."
